# Relational Operators

SQL supports these relational operators (relops):

| Operator       | Description              |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| `=`            | Equal to                 |
| `<`            | Less than                |
| `<=`           | Less than or equal to    |
| `>`            | Greater than             |
| `>=`           | Greater than or equal to |
| `!=` (or `<>`) | Not equal                |
